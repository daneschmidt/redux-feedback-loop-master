## Description

This simple application allows the user to submit feedback based on the questions asked on the various pages.  The user can review all entered feedback at the end before submitting the feedback to the database for preservation.

## Usage

You can use this application by selecting a number between 1 and 5 on each of the question pages.  Once you have entered the number that most closely represents your feelings about the question you can click the next button to advance to the last question. On the final (comments) question you can enter text freely and let us know any comments or thoughts you may have. Next you can see all of your entered answers before clicking the submit button to save your answers to the database. The retake button is available from this final screen in case you would like to retake the survey.
